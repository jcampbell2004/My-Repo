         The Weather Painter Rainbow is your main Boss Monster, being a Link-3 monster with arrows pointing down left, down, and down right. Painters this card points to can banish themselves to negate the activation of an effect. Since it negates the activation, cards that specify you can only activate cards with their name once per turn (such as "Branded Fusion") can activate a second copy of that card, as the first was technically never activated. In addition to the effect it gives any Painter it points to, you can send this Link Summoned card from the field to the GY to negate the Special Summon of an opponent's monster. This is a when effect, much like Solemn Judgment, meaning it can be activated on regular XZY, Synchro, Link, or Pendulum Summon, but not on Special Summons that must first activate an effect in order to be summoned (That's what your Link Arrows are for!). Also, since the card must be sent to the GY to activate this effect, it cannot be used under Shifter.</div>

     
    
    <div id="p2">
         <img src="images/The Weather Painter Moonbow.jfif" alt="The Weather Painter Moonbow">
          The Weather Painter Moonbow is a Link-3 monster with arrows pointing down left, down, and down right, just like Rainbow. When the card is Link Summoned, you can target a banished Weather Painter monster (including Link monsters) and Special Summon it. You can banish a Painter this card points to and target an opponent's monster to banish it until the next Standby Phase. This effect is very situational, but can be very helpful to go for lethal or deal with threats that can hit over Rainbow's mere 2400 Atk, that of which Moonbow shares. If this Link Summoned card is destroyed, you can Special Summon 1 Rainbow from your Extra Deck (This is NOT treated as a Link Summon, so you won't get Rainbows Solemn-like effect). Strangely, this card can use the Quick Effects of other Weather Painter Link monsters and Canvases, but will not return during the next Standby Phase like the Main Deck Painters or Rainbow. Most commonly, you will be using Moonbow to Special Summon a banished Painter and Linking them both off for Accesscode Talker, though you will normally be in a winning position anyways, should this come up as an option.</div>
