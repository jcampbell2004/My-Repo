    <h1>Key Spells and Traps</h1>
<div class="flex-container">
 <div id="p1">
      <img src="images/The Weather Forecast.jfif" alt="The Weather Forecast">
    The Weather Forecast is the archetype's Field Spell, and one of the most important cards in the deck. When this card is first activated, you can place a Canvas face-up directly from your deck. This ensures that you can Normal Summon Snow safely without fear of Veiler or Imperm. Secondly, you can activate this card on the field to Normal Summon a The Weather monster immediately after this effect resolves in addition to your Normal Summon for the turn. Lastly, while this card is face up on the field, you can treat Canvases as Painters for the purposes of Link Summoning a The Weather Link monster (This is NOT an activated effect). By using Cloud's effect after Link Summoning a The Weather Link monster, you can immediately return up to 2 Canvases used for the Link Summon back to the field face-up in your Spell/Trap Zones (While protected by an omni-negate, in Rainbow's case).</div>
    
    <div id="p2">
         <img src="images/The Weather Snowy Canvas.jfif" alt="The Weather Snowy Canvas">
           The Weather Snowy Canvas is a Continuous Spell and the highest priority Canvas for building your board. You can banish a Painter using its effect to get any The Weather card to hand. After this effect resolves, you cannot add cards from your deck to hand for the rest of the turn, except by drawing them. Since the lock is not in effect until it resolves, you can chain this effect multiple times. While only the first Painter to fully resolve the effect gets you a card to hand, this can be useful to avoid board wipes, as even if the effect resolves without effect, the Painters were successfully banished to activate the effect, allowing them to return during the next Standby Phase. Since the search is a Quick Effect, you can also chain it to Droll in order to get a second search per turn.</div>
    
    <div id="p3">
         <img src="images/The Weather Rainbowed Canvas.jfif" alt="The Weather Rainbowed Canvas">
           The Weather Rainbowed Canvas is a Continuous Trap and is one of your main ways of building advantage. If your opponent controls a monster (it does not need to be face-up), you can banish a Painter to Special Summon another Painter from deck. You cannot Special Summon from deck for the rest of the turn after this effect resolves, which can turn off other cards such as PSY-Framegear Gamma, which may need to summon PSY-Frame Driver from the deck. Since all but one Painter returns after using a The Weather Quick Effect, this ends up being a plus 1 during the next Standby Phase. If you suspect that your opponent has an Ash Blossom & Joyous Spring, though, you could be giving up a negate for the turn in the process.</div>
