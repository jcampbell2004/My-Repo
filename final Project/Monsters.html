          The Weather Painter Snow is your starter and most important card. On Normal Summon, Snow lets you place 1 The Weather Continuous Spell/Trap face-up directly from deck. This allows you to immediately get more Canvases in rotation as well as get your Continuous Traps face-up without wasting a turn, if need be</div>
    
   
    <div id="p2">
         <img src="images/Weather Painter Cloud.jpg" alt="Weather Painter Cloud">
          The Weather Painter Cloud is used to retrieve Canvases that are in the GY. When a face-up The Weather card you control is sent to the GY by any means, you can target up to 2 Canvases in your GY that have names you do not currently control and place them face up in your Spell/Trap Zones.</div>
   


   <div id="p3">
        <img src="images/Weather Painter Thunder.png" alt="Weather Painter Thunder">
         The Weather Painter Thunder can send 1 Continuous Spell/Trap you control to the GY (does not have to be a The Weather card) to place a Canvas face-up from your deck. This can be used to trigger Cloud's effect, though cannot be activated under Shifter, due to the requirement of sending the original Continuous Spell/Trap to the GY as cost making it an illegal activation. You can also use Thunder's effect to turn a used Rainbowed Canvas into an unused Snowy Canvas to get extra Painters and Canvases in rotation.</div>
