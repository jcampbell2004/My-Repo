       <h1>What is Weather Painter?</h1>

    <div id="p1">Weather Painter, also known as "The Weather", is an archetype of Level 3 Fairy monsters (and one Level 6) that use Continuous Spell/Traps to apply various effects, allowing you to banishing monsters you control for cost and returning them to the field during the next Standby Phase..</div>
    
    
      <h1>How does the deck work?</h1>
    <div id="p2">The archetype consists of Effect monsters called "Painters" and Continuous Spell/Traps called "Canvases". Weather Painter monsters in the Main Monster Zone that are either in the same column or the adjacent column of a Canvas gain its effects as a Quick Effect. Since Painters banish themselves for cost, you can dodge the effects of Infinite Impermanence and Effect Veiler, due to their target changing location, and ignore the effects of Skill Drain, as Painters have their effects resolve in the Banished Zone, not the field. The end goal is to create a Link-3 The Weather monster from your Extra Deck that gives an additional Quick Effect to Painters that the Link monster points to. Keep in mind that the Quick Effects granted to Painters by both their Link-3 monsters and Continuous Spell/Traps are best taken advantage of when placed in overlapping positions to increase you options during the next turn.</div>
       
      <h1>What are the advantages of a Weather Painter deck?</h1>
    <div id="p4">The Weather Monsters' effects are hard to negate. As long as you have a live Canvas accessible to you, Painters in the Main Monster Zone can banish themselves to dodge interruption and continue your plays. Secondly, if a Painter would be destroyed by an opponent's non-targeting effect, you can activate one of your available Quick Effects to banish it before the destruction effects resolves, allowing your Painter to still return during the next Standby Phase. The Weather's Boss Monster "The Weather Painter Rainbow" allows you banish Painters it points to for an Omni-Negate, then have them return to the field next turn to continue amassing resources and out advantage your opponent.</div>
