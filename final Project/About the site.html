       <h1>Why Weather Painters?</h1>

    <div id="p1">Right now, The current Yugioh meta is extremely boring to me. I very rarely have play due to the extremely broken decks that are running around, and when I do play I pretty much auto lose going second. Weather Painters made this boring game fun for me and actually helped me enjoy the game alot more.</div>
    
    
      <h1>when did you start playing?</h1>
    <div id="p2">I started playing the game around 2-3 years ago when my brother randomly found it when scrolling on youtube. I started playing weather painters last year, when I saw some of the artwork of the cards.</div>
